# Weekly Index OS — Decision Log

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Create a dedicated repository for index-options workflow instead of continuing inside the FX repo.

### Why
The system needs to be options-native, AEX-specific, and cleanly separated from FX assumptions.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Use an **AEX-primary technical layer** and treat broader cross-market signals as secondary confirmation.

### Why
Reusing the FX ranking environment as the primary technical authority would create a model mismatch.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Replace vague “covered writing” language with **strict financing families**.

### Why
The phrase is too loose for automation and can hide unsafe short-premium behavior.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Separate **directional regime** from **options regime**.

### Why
A good directional view does not automatically imply a good weekly options trade.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Default to **automation maturity level 1** first.

### Why
Weekly options are too path-dependent to jump immediately to full automation.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Maintain both a **human report** and a **machine-readable trade plan**.

### Why
Narrative output alone is not enough for safe state updates and later execution routing.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Use **no-trade** as the default burden-of-proof state.

### Why
Weekly options systems fail when they are biased toward forcing a structure every cycle.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Treat public AEX option-chain coverage as **fallback-grade**, not production-grade.

### Why
Public coverage can be incomplete; the option-surface producer must fail safe and prefer provider-fed input when available.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Validate the machine trade plan before render/send.

### Why
A report should not be rendered or mailed if the trade-plan artifact is internally inconsistent.

---

## 2026-04-02
### Decision
Add a first snapshot-driven weekly report generator that still defaults to **no-trade**.

### Why
The repository needed a real end-to-end pipeline, but it should stay conservative until a real structure builder existed.

---

## 2026-04-03
### Decision
Normalize the control layer to canonical filenames inside `daily-index` and remove inherited FX-only control drift.

### Why
A dedicated AEX repo should not require AEX-prefixed control filenames or contain stale FX control documents as its primary entry points.

---

## 2026-04-03
### Decision
Add a conservative macro snapshot producer, a first strike-aware structure builder, and a portfolio/Greeks refresh layer.

### Why
The repository needed real data depth and a path from regime assessment to structure candidates and live risk-state tracking without jumping to auto-execution.

---

## 2026-04-19
### Decision
Keep `daily-index` as the host repo and add **Weekly Indices Review** as the new primary active report product rather than replacing the repo with a blind ETF clone.

### Why
ETF provides the stronger production workflow and premium delivery pattern, while `daily-index` already provides the cleaner four-layer operating-system architecture and stronger machine-readable state mindset.

---

## 2026-04-19
### Decision
Preserve **AEX Weekly Options** as a parked but intact secondary product track.

### Why
The options-native work remains reusable later and should not be destroyed merely because the primary active report product has changed.

---

## 2026-04-19
### Decision
Use **benchmark index closes** for analysis and **tradable proxy closes** for implemented model-portfolio valuation in Weekly Indices Review.

### Why
The report should remain indices-first in analytical identity while the implemented model portfolio remains realistic and tradeable for NAV, holdings, and equity-curve calculations.

---

## 2026-04-19
### Decision
Port the ETF framework and workflow selectively into `daily-index` through new indices-native runtime, editorial, delivery, workflow, and state files.

### Why
A selective port gives speed and production realism without importing ETF-specific drift into the long-term architecture of `daily-index`.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Freeze the current English Weekly Index baseline as production-valid.

### Why
The May 18 report validated the core output and operational contracts: explicit requested-close token discipline, fresh pricing, Section 7 performance-table ownership, Section 15 holdings/cash-only ownership, Analyst Report visual distinction, ticker linking, render polish, and equity-chart x-axis polish.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Require report token, state artifacts, generated report, and run manifest to follow the requested close date.

### Why
A report priced with May 18 data but delivered under an older May 12 token is operationally misleading. The workflow must fail rather than silently send a stale-token report.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Use Section 7 for `Equity Curve and Portfolio Development`, including `Tradable Proxy Performance`.

### Why
Performance belongs immediately after the equity chart. Section 15 must remain the holdings/cash authority, not a mixed performance appendix.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Use a petrol-teal Analyst Report identity and keep Investor/Analyst separation visible.

### Why
The report contains two reading modes. The reader must clearly see where the Investor Report ends and the Analyst Report begins while preserving an executive, premium visual language.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Maintain a root-level `changelog.md` for meaningful future codebase changes.

### Why
The repo is now production-like enough that Git commits alone are too low-level for handover, debugging and architecture review. Meaningful workflow, renderer, state, prompt, validation and output-contract changes need a human-readable audit trail.

---

## 2026-05-19
### Decision
Start bilingual Weekly Index work only after preserving the English baseline.

### Why
The Dutch report must consume the same state, numbers and report-token contract as the English report. Bilingual work should add a language/rendering layer, not create a second investment model.
